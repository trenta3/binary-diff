When a suffix L or UL is not used, the compiler uses the first type that can contain the constant from a list 
(see details in C99 standard, clause 6.4.4:5. For a decimal constant, the list is int, long int, long long int).

As a consequence, most of the times, it is not necessary to use the suffix. It does not change the meaning of the program. 
It does not change the meaning of your example initialization of x for most architectures, although it would if you had 
chosen a number that could not be represented as a long long. See also codebauer's answer for an example where the U part 
of the suffix is necessary.
