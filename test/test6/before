I try to follow account security best-practices (strong random passwords, password manager, multi-factor authentication, etc.) but I still find myself worried about potential compromises to my accounts, in particular financial accounts (e.g., banks, investments) or accounts that could lead to financial account access (e.g., email, phone). It got me thinking. For people who's net worth is on the order of $10M or $100M or $1B, what additional precautions should they take? Special arrangements with financial institutions? Payments to security specialist firms to monitor/manage all accounts?

This question is related, but the asker didn't understand basic security precautions so the answers tended to be rather basic. One of the comments points out that some rich people completely disregard their security:

Worked for a guy once, owned a decent sized company (and a bunch of smaller ones), with a personal worth of mid-nine figures, and his password for everything was 'bob'. Three guesses what his first name was.
Which is why I'm asking what should high net worth individuals do to secure their financial account access? I'm assuming there must be something given they're a much larger target than Ye Olde Pleb.

Googling around, it seems that some financial institutions offer RSA SecurID. The obvious risk to that is still a phone call to their support team saying you lost it, but it's something.

Bonus question: How much do those extra security measures cost? I.e., at what point in my Inevitable-Rise-to-be-Richer-than-God do I seek out such precautions?
