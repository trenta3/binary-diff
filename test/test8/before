We have a monk in the party who believes that he can run up to an enemy, hit them in the back of the head, and then dive into the grass to hide until the next round.

His argument is that:

He is a wood elf so his Mask of the Wild allows him to hide in lightly obscured areas
Because he hit the target from behind and hid before they turned around they cannot "see" him
I feel that there should be a minimum distance that you must be away from a foe before you can attempt to hide in this kind of circumstance (I realize there are exceptions: complete darkness, invisibility, the creature cannot see, etc).

If i am not mistaken the sequence of actions performed were:

Step 1: Bonus Action: Step of the Wind to Dash behind the opponent; Step 2: Action: Attack Opponent; Step 3: Action: Hide.

So technically he attacked first , then hid in the long grass that was at his and his opponents feet. (just to clarify i believe the grass was just long grass ...not like they were fighting in a corn field or something clearly with cover)
