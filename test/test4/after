I just watched a VSauce2 video, at the end of which certain NASA animations were shown about some of their recent innovations. One of them included use of printers in the ISS.

Do they actually maen a noticeable decrease in cost? I mean, I'm aware that bringing equipment up to these places has huge costs, and I assume 3D printers may decrease the amount of said equipment, as they can create it up there.

What are they precisely used for up there?
